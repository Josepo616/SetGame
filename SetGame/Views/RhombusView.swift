import SwiftUI

/// A custom SwiftUI `View` that renders a rhombus (diamond shape)
/// `RhombusView` draws a four-pointed polygon centered within the available frame
/// using `GeometryReader` to adapt to any size. It supports two modes:
/// - **Filled**: The rhombus is rendered with a solid fill color
/// - **Outlined**: The rhombus is transparent with a colored stroke
/// - Tutorial:
/// ```swift
/// RhombusView(filled: true, color: .red)
///     .frame(width: 50, height: 50)
/// The shape is drawn symmetrically by connecting midpoints of each edge:
/// Top, Right, Bottom, Left â†’ then closing the path
/// Designed for use in card views in a Set game or similar interfaces
///
/// Note:
/// - The rhombus shape is drawn using a closure called `rhombusPoints` which generates
///   the path for the shape. Instead of declaring the points for the shape multiple
///   times, they are now defined in a single closure to reduce redundancy. This results
///   in cleaner and more efficient code.
/// - The closure accepts the width and height of the frame and calculates the four points:
///   Top, Right, Bottom, and Left, and then closes the path.
/// ```
